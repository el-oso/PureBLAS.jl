# Performance

PureBLAS targets a hard, non-negotiable gate: **≥ 0.96× OpenBLAS**, measured per machine, single
threaded. The plots below are the PureBLAS/OpenBLAS speed ratio (so **higher is better; 1.0× is
parity; the dashed line is the 0.96× gate**). Each bar is the geometric mean across sizes; the dark
tick is the *worst* size — a bar is green only when **every** size clears the gate.

Methodology (see `bench/`): single-thread (`BLAS.set_num_threads(1)`), Float64, native PureBLAS API
vs `LinearAlgebra.BLAS`, **interleaved** timing (each round times OpenBLAS then PureBLAS back-to-back
so frequency drift cancels), **median** of many rounds, core pinned with `taskset -c 2`. Reproduce:
`taskset -c 2 julia --project=bench bench/plots.jl`. Numbers here are from a Zen4 (Ryzen, AVX-512
double-pumped); the gate is re-evaluated per host on the dev fleet.

## BLAS-1

Bandwidth-bound; PureBLAS matches or beats OpenBLAS across the board. `nrm2` is markedly faster
because OpenBLAS's `dnrm2` uses the slow always-scaled LAPACK algorithm, while PureBLAS uses a SIMD
sum-of-squares with a scaled fallback only on overflow/underflow.

## BLAS-2

Matrix-vector and the packed/banded variants. The headline lessons (full detail in the project's
`kb/` findings):

- **gemv** is column-major, so `gemv-N` is transpose-like — a size-dispatched **column-panel** kernel
  cuts the y-restream; `gemv-T` is a column-block sharing x-chunks.
- **symv** reads only half of A, so the vector re-stream costs more — a **fused panel** does the
  symmetric `gemv-N + gemv-T` in one pass with the triangular diagonal folded into the same
  accumulators.
- **trmv/trsv** are blocked at large n (diagonal block + off-diagonal `gemv`, reading A once).
- **packed/banded** reuse the same per-column kernels (packed and band columns are contiguous);
  `gbmv` uses convolution-style kernels with BLASFEO-style register reuse for wide bands.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Scope | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **M1** | BLAS-1 (axpy, dot, nrm2, asum, scal, copy, swap, iamax; s/d/c/z) | ✅ gate met; LBT `.so` + native API |
| **M2** | `dgemm` (BLIS 5-loop + SIMD microkernel; unpacked small-matrix path) | ✅ single-thread parity (geomean ≈ 1.0×) |
| **M3 (core L2)** | gemv, ger, symv, hemv, trmv, trsv + packed (spmv/hpmv/tpmv/tpsv) and banded (gbmv/sbmv/hbmv/tbmv/tbsv) | ✅ gate met across the surface |
| **M4** | multithreading | deferred |

Both consumption modes share one kernel set: the **native API** (`PureBLAS.gemv!(…)`, AD-traceable)
and the **LBT drop-in** `.so` (`@ccallable` ILP64 symbols via `juliac --trim`).
